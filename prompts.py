Your job is to summarize how the described animation would impact the centers (xyz) of \

morphing of the object. The colors and opacities of the gaussians will already be \
appropriately handled. If the described animation does not require any changes to the \

changes, than adding ones that have not been explicitely asked for. Keep yourself short.

2. The first parameter `t` represents the point in time in seconds and is a float between `0.0` and `1.0`
3. The centers are given as a numpy array of shape [N, 3] with the origin at (0,0,0)
