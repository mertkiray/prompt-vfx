You will receive a short description of the desired animation as user input.
Your job is to summarize how the described animation would impact the centers (xyz) of
the individual gaussians. The colors and opacities of the gaussians will already be
appropriately handled, so do not add any unnecessary effects.

### 1. Radial Displacement
- Points close to the explosion center would be displaced outward, mimicking the
  shockwave and expanding gases.
- The displacement is proportional to the strength of the explosion and inversely
  proportional to the distance from the explosion's epicenter. Points farther from the
  epicenter would experience less movement.
### 2. Random Perturbations
- Real explosions introduce turbulence. Points may experience random jitter or noise,
  representing chaotic air and debris movement.
- Random offsets could be added to each xyz value:
### 3. Directional Effects
- Explosions are rarely isotropic (equally powerful in all directions). They might be
  influenced by barriers, open spaces, or directional blasts.
- A direction vector could bias the displacement
### 4. Scaling and Debris Generation
- Some points may disappear (e.g., they belong to objects destroyed or moved out of the field of view).
- New points might be added to simulate debris fields, calculated based on the explosion's properties.
### 5. Velocity Simulation (if time is involved)
- If simulating over time, you might compute initial velocities for points and update
  positions iteratively, while Accounting for forces like gravity, drag, and friction can
  further refine the motion.

<example-output>
### 1. Brightness and Intensity Changes
- Core Explosion (Bright Hot Core):
  - At the center of the explosion, the brightness would spike significantly due to the intense heat and light. Gaussians in this area would adopt high-intensity colors, often dominated by white, yellow, or orange.
  - The luminance values of the Gaussians would increase sharply.
- Fading Edges (Dimming Effect):
  - As the explosion's light radiates outward, intensity would decrease, leading to a gradient of diminishing brightness. Gaussians farther from the center would have lower intensities.

### 2. Hue Transformation
- Thermal Colors:
  - In the early stages of an explosion, the colors often follow the blackbody radiation spectrum:
    - White/Yellow Core: Hottest region with intense heat.
    - Orange to Red Mid-Layer: Cooler but still hot regions where thermal energy dissipates.
    - Smoke Colors (Gray, Brown): These appear in cooler, less radiant areas as particles cool and mix with surrounding air.
- Chemical Reactions:
  - If the explosion involves chemicals (e.g., fireworks or fuel), additional hues like greens, blues, and purples may appear, depending on the specific chemical compounds.

### 3. Spatial Color Gradient
- Radial Gradient:
  - The Gaussians would exhibit a radial gradient of color and intensity, starting from a hot, bright center to darker and more diffuse hues at the edges.
- Irregular Distributions:
  - Realistic explosions are often chaotic. This means the colors and intensities of Gaussians would not be perfectly symmetric or uniform, reflecting the turbulent nature of the explosion.

### 4. Transparency and Alpha Modulation
- Smoke and Debris:
  - As the explosion evolves, semi-transparent smoke and particulate debris would alter the alpha (opacity) values of Gaussians.
  - Near the edges, Gaussians might fade to near-transparency to simulate the dissipation of light and smoke.

### 1. Density Redistribution
   - An explosion creates a rapid outward propagation of particles (e.g., smoke, debris, fire), redistributing the density of the material. Areas close to the explosion's core may become highly dense (high opacity), while others farther away become more sparse (low opacity).
   - Gaussian opacities would need to increase sharply in the central regions and decrease gradually with distance from the explosion, based on the energy propagation model (e.g., a shockwave or heat dissipation model).

### 2. Dynamic Range of Opacity
   - Explosions often feature regions of intense brightness (fireball) and near-opacity (smoke or dust). Gaussians in bright areas may become nearly opaque to represent flame cores, while peripheral Gaussians representing translucent smoke would need gradually decreasing opacities.
   - Temporal variations in opacity could follow a physics-based model, using parameters like pressure, temperature, and particle density to modulate the opacity values dynamically over time.

### 3. Shockwave and Fragmentation Effects
   - The explosion shockwave would clear out regions, reducing opacity by dispersing Gaussians into a more transparent state. Conversely, fragmented debris or denser particulate regions would cause localized opacity spikes.
   - Modify Gaussian opacities to reflect localized clearing or aggregation of density caused by the shockwave. The opacity may exhibit temporal pulsations as shockwave effects propagate.
